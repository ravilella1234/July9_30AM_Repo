Locators --> 8 types
--------------------

id() :- ID is the most preferred way to locate elements on a page, as each ID is supposed to be unique which makes id's a very faster & reliable way to locate elements.

	Syntax: driver.findElement(By.id("id Attribute value"));


Name() :- This is also an efficient way to locate elements with name attribute.After ID's give it your second preference but likewise ID's,name attributes don't have to unique in a page.

	Syntax:  driver.findElement(By.name("name attribute value");



ClassName() :- ClassName is used for applying CSS to elements in the application 
	       Multiple elements can have the same class property.

Note: The above 3 locators are called original properties because the developer 
might or might not assign.

	Syntax: driver.findElement(By.className("class attribute value"));


linkText() & partialLinkText() :-
       These 2 locators are used only when working on links.When we give complete linkname we use linkText().When we give section of link name we use partialLinkText()

	Syntax: driver.findElement(By.linkText("Name of the link")); ----> (create an account)
		driver.findElement(By.partialLinkText("partial Link name"));  ---> (create an)
	

Ex: inbox link in Gmail we use partial link Text Property



xpath() :- This represents the adress of the element and it is always unique.xpath is classified into 2 types
   1. Absolute Xpath  -- Allways starts with html tag
   2. Relative Xpath  -- starts with //

Note : Though xpath can identify any any element uniquely it will slow down the speed of the program

	Syntax: driver.findElement(By.xpath(xpathExpression));
	


cssSelector() :- It stands for cascading style sheets.This is used by developers to apply colours and fonts.This is also a very fast locator,similar to id.css is also of 2 types

		1. Relative
		2. absolute

	Syntax : driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(selector));



tagName() :- This represents the html tag of the elements,and it is generally used when working on multiple elements.

	Syntax : driver.findElements(By.tagName(name of that tag));



				WebDriver Methods(13)
				-----------------------

WebDriver uses 13 methods to perform various activities on the webapplication

1. get() --> This uses to navigate to a URL
	Ex: driver.get("URL");

2. getTitle() --> This will capture the title of the page opened by WebDriver
	Ex: driver.getTitle();

3. getCurrentURL() --> This will capture the url of the page opened by WebDriver
	EX: driver.getCurrentUrl();

4. getPageSource() --> This will capture html source code of the page opened by WebDriver
	EX: driver.getPageSource();

5. findElement() --> This is used to identify one element on the page.This identification can be done based on any of the locators previously discussed
	EX: driver.findElement(By.locator());

6. findElements() --> This is used to identify multiple elements on the webapplication.This can also be used all the 8 locators
	EX: driver.findElements(By.locator());

7. close() --> This is used to close the application opened by WebDriver.It will close only one window.Where the control of WebDriver is present.
	EX: driver.close();

8. quit() --> This is used to close all the windows & tabs ,opened by WebDriver
	EX: driver.quit();

9. getWindowHandle() --> When ever selenium launches a window it assigns a unique id to every window.
			 We can capture this window handler using this method.
	EX: driver.getWindowHandle();

10. getWindowHandles() --> When multiple windows are opened by WebDriver 
			   when we want to capture all their id's we can use this methods.
	EX: driver.getWindowHandles();

11. switchTo() --> This method is used to switch from one window to another window.
		   also can used to switch into a frame.
                   also can used to switch into an alert.
		   also can used to switch to main page opened by webdriver
	EX: driver.switchTo().window();
	    driver.switchTo().alert();
	    driver.switchTo().frame();

12. navigate() --> This also used to navigate to a url 
			It can be used to click on backward or forward buttons of the browser
	Ex: driver.navigate().to("URL");
	    driver.navigate().back();
	    driver.navigate().forward();
	    driver.navigate().refresh();

13. manage() --> This used for performing various activities like maximizing the browser size,setting
	         implecit waits, capturing cookies info etc.....
	EX: driver.manage()............


	Operations on WebElements
	---------------------------------

1. click() --> This is used to clickon link,image,button,checkbox,radiobutton etc....

2. sendKeys() --> This is used for entering text into input fields

3. clear() --> This used for clearing the input fields before entering some data.

4. getText() --> This will capture any visible text in application

5. getAttribute() --> This will capture the properties of a webElement

6. getLocation().x --> This will capture the x coordinate of a webElement

7. getLocation().y --> This will capture the y coordinate of a webElement

8. getSize() --> This will capture the size of an input fields

9. getTagName() --> This will capture the html tag of web elements

10. isDisplayed() --> This is used to check if a webelement is visible or hidden

11. isSelected() --> This is used to check if a check box is selected or an option in dropdown is selected or radio button is selected

12. isEnabled() --> This used to find if a webElement is enabled or disabled
